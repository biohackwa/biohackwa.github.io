In order to hit the ground running, please make sure you have taken care of the following:

## Hardware
* Laptop computer running Linux, Mac OS X or Windows
  * A good keyboard and mouse will make life much easier. 
* For those of you planning to continue working with coding and electronics at home (otherwise these can be borrowed during the open lab):
  * Arduino UNO microcontroller + USB cable or [a cheaper equivalent board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems#Arduino_footprint-compatible_boards) such as Freeduino, Seeeduino or Sparkfun Redboard.
  UNO alternatives are available from China's [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/high-quality-UNO-R3-MEGA328P-CH340-CH340G-for-Arduino-UNO-R3-USB-CABLE/32339945138.html?spm=2114.01010208.3.1.x3sgHg&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_2_10065_10068_10000009_10084_10083_10080_10082_10081_10060_10061_10062_10056_10055_10037_10054_10059_10032_10099_10078_10079_10077_427_426_10103_10073_10102_10096_10052_10050_10051_10106,searchweb201603_4,afswitch_4&btsid=c92e3c5f-3ca0-4446-8226-31c68f00950e), although they take 1-2 months to deliver.
  * We also welcome other kinds of MCUs like Raspberry, Particle, BeagleBone, Galileo, etc, but you'll have to write the code and do the wiring from scratch
  * A [BioHack Academy Board](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BioHackBoard) can be made from scratch (parts+pcb will be available during the course)
  * Also check the [suppliers page](/suppliers/) for stores to purchase electronic components
  * You will also need a soldering iron, multimeter, helping hand, solder and heat shrink

## Software
* Text or code editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, Xcode, gedit, etc
  * A syntax colouring tool is preferred, and will make life easier. 
  * My personal preference is [SublimeText3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) (OSX,Win,Linux)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * You will use this to pull instructions, designs and code for each lab device that is to be build.
  * You will also use this to manage your documentation webpage
* [Arduino IDE 1.8](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for programming the Arduino microcontroller
* [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/download)
  * [SVG export plugin](https://github.com/JoakimSoderberg/sketchup-svg-outline-plugin) 
* As an alternative (not covered in the course): [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) and [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org) for parametric 3D design
* [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/) for documenting electronic circuits (we might switch to something more usable). You may use EagleCad or KiCad too, but the usage is not taught in the course
* [InkScape](https://www.inkscape.org/en/) for editing vector drawings
* [Cura](http://software.ultimaker.com/) for operating the 3D printer (Makerbot, Tarantula, Ultimakers)

## Cloudware
* Register an account on the following website:
  * [GitHub.org](http://www.github.org) for sharing your code and after the second class you will set up your personal academy page using [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) 
  * [Circuits.io](http://circuits.io/) for easy virtual breadboarding, circuit design, simulation and layout.
  * [Disqus.com](https://disqus.com) for commenting on the BioHack Academy syllabus

## Wetware
In case you wish to do experiments at home you will need the following equipment, otherwise these will be provided for in the lab:

* Fridge, freezer and stove
* Pressure cooker (6 Liters or more)
* Empty glass marmalade or vegetable jars
* Pasteur Transfer Pipettes (disposible single use are fine), 15 mL volume pipettes (don't forget the pipetting balloon) and micropipettes (Gilson, Pipetman or go for cheap Huawei via Alibaba)
* A scale, 1 gram accuracy will do for most of the work. Perhaps also consider having a gold scale for smaller amounts [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xgold+scale&_nkw=gold+scale&_sacat=0).
* A Bunsen/gas burner - you can find alternatives in camping supply stores
* Lab coats

That's it, you're all set!
